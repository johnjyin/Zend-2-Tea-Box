Zend Framework 2 Web App: Tea Box
=======================

Introduction
------------
How we could deem Zend Framework as one of the most powerful but easy-to-use MVC framework for building web applications?

In this series tutorial, I share the straightfoward steps to create a complete Zend Framework 2 (ZF2) application: Tea Box, like one online tea shop, which is so flexible that all the tea boxes can be rearranged according to the size of browser.

The 1st part of this tutorial is in synchronization with the ZF2's offical tutorial: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/user-guide/skeleton-application.html" target="_blank">Album</a>, and you can look at it as its appending document because the offical online document is version related, and is not quite friendly to beginner. As well, I will explore some advanced applications in latter parts, in addition to the basic CRUD operations.
